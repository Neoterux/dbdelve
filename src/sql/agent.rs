//! The single answer for a statement an agent originates: run it, ask the human
//! to approve it, or refuse it by name.
//!
//! [`agent_gate`] is a pure function of `(engine, sql, mode)`. It reads no
//! profile, no silenced confirmation and no earlier approval, so the mode passed
//! for a call is the ceiling for that call and nothing else, and two callers
//! cannot change each other's answers. It reads the parse [`super::classify`]
//! judges and decides about the text as written; it never returns another text.
//!
//! The ladder, each step returning at once. Steps 1 to 6 do not depend on the
//! mode, so a refusal's reason is the same on every profile.
//!
//! 1. `Unreadable` in the verdict is `Refuse(Unreadable)`, before `gate` is
//!    asked: `gate` answers `Upgrade` for an unreadable statement on an engine
//!    with no server-side hold, which would read as a negotiation. An
//!    unreadable statement that is seen to remove data is named a
//!    `Refuse(Delete)` (D-10): MongoDB's legacy `remove` is no method DBDelve
//!    reads, and it is still a deletion. One seen to disclose (a MongoDB
//!    `db.currentOp()`, a Redis `CONFIG GET` before a command DBDelve cannot
//!    read) is a `Refuse(Disclosure)`; a deletion is asked first.
//! 2. The statement count: the parse `classify` judged and the buffer's token
//!    bearing ranges. None is `Refuse(NoStatement)`, two or more is
//!    `Refuse(MoreThanOne)`.
//! 3. A Redis command the editor never sends (`MONITOR`, `SELECT`, ...) is
//!    `Refuse(NotSent)`, after the count so two commands are `MoreThanOne`.
//! 4. `DROP` is `Refuse(Drop)`, `TRUNCATE` is `Refuse(Truncate)`, any `DELETE`
//!    the walk reached, filtered or not, is `Refuse(Delete)`, and an `ALTER
//!    TABLE` carrying anything but `ADD COLUMN` is `Refuse(Alter)`.
//! 5. A server-side script (a Redis `EVAL`, `FCALL` and their read-only forms,
//!    a MongoDB `$where`) is `Refuse(Script)`, and a command that returns
//!    credentials, password hashes, the user's privileges or other clients'
//!    details (Redis `CONFIG GET`, `CLIENT LIST`, `ACL LIST`, `ACL GETUSER`;
//!    MongoDB `currentOp`, `connectionStatus` with `showPrivileges`) is
//!    `Refuse(Disclosure)` (D-27), in every mode: before the session and mode
//!    steps, so the reason is the script's and not the mode's.
//! 6. A statement that changes the session, or assigns a user variable with
//!    `:=`, is `Refuse(Session)`: a later approved write must hit the table the
//!    human read it for, so nothing an agent sends may repoint the session
//!    unseen. Stateless engines included. A plain read of what the session
//!    holds, `currval` or `last_insert_id()`, stays a read where the engine lists
//!    it.
//! 7. A verdict that needs `Mode::Full` is `Refuse(NeedsFull)`: a Full profile
//!    grants an agent nothing a Read-write one does not.
//! 8. `gate(&verdict, mode, &[])` stopping the statement for the mode is
//!    `Refuse(NeedsMode { needed, held })`. The silenced list is always empty,
//!    so a kind a human silenced changes nothing for an agent.
//! 9. A write the profile's mode allows is `Approve(verdict)`.
//! 10. A read that calls one of the engine's `egress_functions`, or on DuckDB
//!     holds a string that looks like a path ([`reads_a_bare_path`]), is
//!     `Approve(verdict)` with a Read-only verdict, in every mode: it reaches a
//!     file, a URL, a program or another server, and the human sees the
//!     statement first. After every refusal and after step 9, so a refused
//!     statement stays refused and a write that also reads a file is approved
//!     as the write it is. It narrows what the mode lets run and never widens
//!     it.
//! 11. A read that calls a function its engine's `builtin_functions` does not
//!     name is `Approve(verdict)` with a Read-only verdict at Read-write and
//!     Full, and `Run`s at Read-only: the call may be a user-defined function
//!     that writes, and at Read-write and Full no engine holds one back. The
//!     name is judged as written, so a schema-qualified or quoted one is
//!     unlisted. It narrows what the mode lets run and never widens it.
//! 12. Anything else is a read, and `Run`s.
//!
//! The mode stays the ceiling: `Run` and `Approve` both imply that `gate` with
//! the same mode and no silenced kind lets the statement through, and the
//! corpus in `sql_snapshots::agent` holds that over every cell.
