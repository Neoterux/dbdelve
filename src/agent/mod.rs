//! One socket connection is one call: closing it is the cancel, so there is no
//! cancel frame. The app side is std threads and a channel, and the window
//! reaches them only through [`Inbound`] arriving on the pump in
//! `workspace::agent`. [`Status`], [`Reply`] and [`Inbound`] are the
//! vocabulary both halves speak, and they build on every OS; the socket itself
//! is Unix only.
//!
//! `wire`, `tools`, `ipc` and the shim never name gpui, `crate::db` or the
//! keychain: they are the part that can be read, and run, without a window and
//! without a database.
