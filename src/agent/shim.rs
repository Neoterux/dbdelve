//! `dbdelve mcp`: the process Claude Code starts, speaking MCP on its stdio.
//!
//! This is the only file that names rmcp or tokio's sockets. It answers
//! `initialize` and `server/discover` itself, answers `tools/list` from the
//! static table in [`super::tools`] without connecting anywhere, and carries
//! each `tools/call` to the app over one connection of its own. The shim never
//! opens a database connection and answers nothing but `app_not_running` on its
//! own: every other status is the app's. A call that is cancelled is cancelled
//! by hanging up its connection, and no frame says so.
//!
//! Nothing here is remembered between calls about the app: whether it is
//! running is decided at each call, by whether its socket takes a connection.
