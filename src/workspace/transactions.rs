//! Transaction control the user drives: the auto-commit switch, Commit and
//! Rollback.
//!
//! Every statement these send is written into the buffer first and runs from
//! there, the way a grid edit's batch does (`sql::appended_statement`). That
//! is the whole design: `AGENTS.md` hard rule 1 leaves no room for a `BEGIN`
//! dbdelve puts on the wire unseen, so the `BEGIN` goes where it can be read,
//! edited and undone, and what runs is what is on screen.
