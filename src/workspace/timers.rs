//! Per-profile timers: the work a connection does on its own, between the
//! user's gestures.
//!
//! Each is a one-shot `Task` on the background executor that re-arms itself
//! when its round lands, and is held on the `Profile` so that replacing it
//! re-arms and dropping it cancels. A repeating timer would keep every test's
//! scheduler busy for ever (`docs/agents/session.md`), so every timer here is
//! off unless the profile asks, and nothing arms one for a profile that has
//! not connected.
//!
//! The blocking round trips run through [`spawn_blocking`], never on GPUI's
//! executor, which has no reactor to drive a socket.
