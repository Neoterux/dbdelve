//! Redis commands, read by DBDelve: the Redis counterpart of `sql.rs` and
//! `mql.rs`.
//!
//! A buffer holds one command per line, split into words by redis-cli's own
//! rules (`sdssplitargs`), so a line pasted from redis-cli means here what it
//! meant there. A line whose first character is `#` is a comment, DBDelve's
//! addition; redis-cli would send it.
//!
//! Classifying a command is a lookup by its name (and subcommand, where the
//! word after the name decides: `CONFIG GET` writes nothing and is
//! rated a write for what it returns, `requirepass` and `masterauth`, while
//! `CONFIG SET` is destructive). The server has no Read-only hold to fall back
//! on, so this is the whole boundary, and a name the table does not know is
//! unreadable.
