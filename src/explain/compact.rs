//!
//! It prints from the same [`Analysis`] the plan view draws, so the two cannot
//! disagree about which node is hot, and it computes no share, tier,
//! misestimate or basis of its own.
//!
//! The plan text comes from servers and from the tables and columns anyone
//! wrote, and an agent reads it next to the structure this module writes. So
//! structure is only ever written where this module puts it: `truncated:`,
//! `plan:`, `findings:` and `tree:` start a line at column 0 and nothing else
//! does. Every server string is put on one line and written after an
//! indentation and an `n<index>` or `| ` prefix, except the summary's two time
//! values, which sit inside quotes on the `plan:` line with backslash and quote
//! escaped. Every server line is clipped at [`PLAN_LINE_CAP`] characters.
//! Everything this module writes is ASCII; the raw lines of a plan that is a
//! table or flat text are the server's own words, and may not be.
